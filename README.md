## 📖 Component Guide

### Atoms

Base-level, stateless UI primitives. Use these directly or compose them into molecules.

- `Button` — primary, secondary, and loading states.
- `AmountInput` — numeric input with token denomination label.
- `ProgressBar` — milestone completion indicator.
- `Toast` — auto-dismissing notification bubble (integrated globally).
- `ThemeToggle` — dark/light mode switcher (integrated in Navbar).

**Using Toast Notifications:**

```tsx
import { useGlobalToast } from '../pages/_app'

function MyComponent() {
  const toast = useGlobalToast()

  const handleSuccess = () => toast.success('Transaction confirmed!')
  const handleError = () => toast.error('Connection failed')
  const handleWarning = () => toast.warning('Low balance detected')
  const handleInfo = () => toast.info('Fetching data...')

  return <button onClick={handleSuccess}>Show Toast</button>
}
```

### Molecules

Stateful compositions built from atoms.

- `FormPledge` — full pledge form with validation and submission.
- `TransactionModal` — step-by-step transaction status overlay.
- `WalletData` — connected wallet summary card.
- `Deposits` — list of active deposits with release controls.

### Organisms

Full page sections wired to on-chain data.

- `Navbar` — responsive top nav with wallet connect.
- `Campaign` — campaign detail with funding progress.
- `Pledge` — pledge workflow from input to confirmation.

## 🧭 Architecture Notes

- The project currently uses the Next.js Pages Router. The Freelancer Leaderboard is implemented at `pages/leaderboard.tsx` to match the existing routing convention.
- The leaderboard is backed by typed local sample data until the protocol exposes a public ranking endpoint or indexer query. The UI sorts the same dataset by total escrow earnings or reputation score.
- The profile page fetches reputation, bio, and past gigs from `GET /api/profile`, which proxies to `PROFILE_API_BASE_URL` when configured and falls back to typed mock data for local/dev environments.
- No new runtime dependencies were added for this feature.

### Contract Bindings Codegen

TrustFlow uses a codegen pipeline to generate fully typed TypeScript client bindings from Soroban contract specs. This ensures all frontend contract calls are compile-time checked and stay in sync with the contract interface.

**How it works:**

1. Contract specs are defined as JSON files in `shared/contracts-raw/`
2. Running `npm run codegen` generates TypeScript bindings in `shared/contracts-gen/`
3. The `npm run build` and `npm run dev` commands automatically run codegen

**Adding a new contract:**

1. Create a spec file: `shared/contracts-raw/mycontract.spec.json`
2. Run `npm run codegen`
3. Import the generated client: `import { createMycontractContract } from '../shared/contracts-gen'`

**Generated files:**

- `shared/contracts-gen/escrow.ts` — Escrow contract types and client
- `shared/contracts-gen/dispute.ts` — Dispute contract types and client
- `shared/contracts-gen/index.ts` — Barrel export

---

## 🛡️ Security

- No private keys ever touch the browser — all signing delegated to Freighter.
- Contract IDs and RPC URLs loaded strictly from environment variables.
- XDR simulation run before every transaction submission.
